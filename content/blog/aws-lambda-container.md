# **AWS Lambda Containers: A Game-Changer for Scalable and Efficient Serverless Applications**

Simplify the deployment of Docker containers as Lambda functions on AWS using Terraform. This code snippet creates a Lambda function module, and effortlessly deploys a container image. Customize the function name, description, and provide the private ECR image URI for a seamless deployment experience. Streamline your AWS Lambda deployment process and unleash the power of containerization with this efficient Terraform solution.

## **Use Cases**
1. **Serverless Microservices:** Deploy Docker containers as Lambda functions using Terraform to create serverless microservices architectures. Benefit from independent scaling and optimized resource utilization by encapsulating specific functionalities or services within each containerized Lambda function.

2. **CI/CD Pipelines:** Streamline your CI/CD pipelines by deploying Docker containers on AWS Lambda with Terraform. Automate the deployment of containerized applications as Lambda functions, ensuring consistent and reliable deployment across multiple environments like development, staging, and production.

3. **Scheduled Tasks and Cron Jobs:** Terraform enables you to schedule Docker container execution as Lambda functions, making it ideal for automating routine tasks, cron jobs, and scheduled processes. Whether it's data backups, periodic data processing, or system maintenance, you can leverage Lambda's built-in scheduling capabilities to execute containerized tasks at specific intervals.

## **How It Works**

- Provision an AWS Lambda function running a Docker container using Terraform:
  - Configure the AWS provider with the desired profile and region.
  - Utilize the `terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws` module.
  - Provide function name, description, and image URI for the container.
  - Customize additional parameters as needed.
- Running the Terraform code:
  - Install Terraform, navigate to the code directory, and initialize.
  - Preview the plan with `terraform plan` and apply changes with `terraform apply`.
  - Review the output for details of the created Lambda function.
- Cleaning up resources:
  - Use `terraform destroy` when the Lambda function is no longer needed.
- Exercise caution, review, and test the code before using in production.

## **Usage**

Requirements
* AWS CLI
* Terraform

**Note:** Make sure you have an existing Docker image uploaded to your private Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Run the following commands

```
terraform init
```
```
terraform plan
```
```
terraform apply
```
