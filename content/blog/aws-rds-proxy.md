## **Use Cases**
1. **Flexible Traffic Redirection:** Provides exceptional flexibility for redirecting and distributing database traffic to accommodate evolving application requirements. It enables seamless redirection of incoming traffic across multiple database instances without the need to modify application code.

2. **Highly Scalable Database Connections:** Simplifies managing database connections. With connection pooling and automatic scaling, it handles thousands of concurrent connections, ensuring scalability for your applications.

3. **Improved Database Performance:** By leveraging AWS RDS Proxy, you can enhance the performance of your applications that interact with the database. RDS Proxy helps reduce connection establishment times and handles connection pooling efficiently, resulting in faster response times and improved overall database performance.

## **Requirements**
| Name     | Version  |
|----------|----------|
|[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) | >= 1.0 |
|[AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli)  | >= 2.0 |
|[OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/)   | >= 2.5 |

## **Installation**

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/BlackArrowGang/Arsenal.git
```
Go to the solution directory
```
cd /Arsenal/quiver/aws-rds-proxy
```
Install terraform modules
```
terraform init
```

## **Usage**

**Note:** It might take a few minutes to fully create.

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Run the following commands

```
terraform plan
```
```
terraform apply
```

## **How It Works**
- **Provider and VPC Configuration:**
  - Configure the AWS provider with the default profile and region.
  - Use the `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws` module to create a VPC.
    - Specify the VPC name, availability zones, CIDR block, private subnets, and database subnets.

- **RDS Proxy Configuration:**
  - Use the `terraform-aws-modules/rds-proxy/aws` module to create an RDS Proxy.
    - Specify the RDS Proxy name, IAM role name, and authentication mode.
    - Create IAM policy and role if enabled.
    - Configure VPC subnet IDs and security group IDs.
    - Define RDS Proxy endpoints for read-write operations.
    - Configure secrets for the RDS Proxy.

- **RDS Aurora Configuration:**
  - Use the `terraform-aws-modules/rds-aurora/aws` module to create an RDS Aurora cluster.
    - Specify the Aurora cluster name, engine, engine mode, and engine version.
    - Set up the master username and password.
    - Configure availability zones, instance class, and scaling configuration.
    - Define VPC ID, database subnet group, and security group IDs.
    - Set up security group rules, monitoring interval, encryption, and tags.

- **Security Group Configuration:**
  - Create a VPN access security group using the `terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws` module.
    - Specify the security group name, description, and VPC ID.
    - Allow inbound traffic on UDP port 443 from any IP address.

  - Create an RDS access security group using the same module.
    - Specify the security group name, description, and VPC ID.
    - Allow inbound and outbound traffic on TCP port 5432 to and from itself.

  - Create a resource access security group using the same module.
    - Specify the security group name, description, and VPC ID.
    - Allow all inbound and outbound traffic to and from itself.

- **KMS Key Configuration:**
  - Use the `terraform-aws-modules/kms/aws` module to create a KMS key.
    - Specify the key description and usage.
    - Assign an alias to the KMS key.

- **Secrets Configuration:**
  - Create an AWS Secrets Manager secret for the RDS superuser credentials.
    - Specify the secret name, description, and KMS key ID.

  - Create a secret version for the RDS superuser credentials.
    - Associate the secret version with the previously created secret.
    - Set the username and password for the RDS superuser.

- **Client VPN Configuration:**
  - Create an AWS Client VPN endpoint.
    - Specify the description, server certificate ARN, client CIDR block, split tunneling, VPC ID, and security group IDs.
    - Configure certificate-based authentication with the root certificate chain ARN.
    - Disable connection logging.

  - Authorize VPN access to the VPC.
    - Associate the Client VPN endpoint with the VPC and allow access to all groups.

  - Associate subnets with the Client VPN endpoint.
    - Associate the Client VPN endpoint with each private subnet in the VPC.
