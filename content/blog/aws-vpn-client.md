## **Use Cases**
The AWS VPN setup can be utilized in various scenarios, including:

1. **Remote Access (Bastion Alternative)**: Provide a secure alternative to a bastion by enabling authorized users to securely connect with high availability to AWS resources through a virtual private network (VPN) from remote locations.

2. **Site-to-Site Connectivity**: Establish secure connections between multiple on-premises data centers or branch offices and the AWS cloud, enabling seamless and protected communication between these environments, including multi-region deployments.

3. **Third-Party Vendor Access**: Many enterprises work with external vendors or consultants who require access to specific resources for collaboration or system integration. Cloud network security plays a vital role in this scenario. This VPN can provide a secure and controlled connection for these vendors to access the necessary resources without exposing the internal network to external threats.

## **Requirements**
| Name     | Version  |
|----------|----------|
|[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) | >= 1.0 |
|[AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli)  | >= 2.0 |
|[OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/)   | >= 2.5 |

## **Installation**
### Install a OpenVPN client
   - Desktop version
      - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/client-vpn-download/" target="_blank">AWS Desktop client</a>
   - linux (Debian)
      ```
      sudo apt install openvpn
      ```
---

### Download Module
Inside your terraform proyect, create a "modules" directory
```
mkdir modules
```

Move into that directory
```
cd modules
```

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/BlackArrowGang/Arsenal.git
```

Go to the solution directory
```
cd /Arsenal/quiver/aws-vpn-client
```
or just copy the folder directly into modules
```
cd /modules/aws-vpn-client
```

### AWS VPN Certificates Setup

 - Refer to this <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/mutual.html" target="_blank">AWS</a>
   documentation for detailed instructions on how to create and import the vpn certificates on your account.

## **Usage**

**Example Code**
```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "5.0.0"

  name = "Custom_VPC"
  cidr = "142.32.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["us-east-2a", "us-east-2b"]
  private_subnets = ["142.32.1.0/24", "142.32.2.0/24"]
}

module "vpn" {
    source = "./modules/aws-vpn-client"

    resource_port = 5432
    vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id
    vpc_cidr_block = module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block
    
    private_subnets = module.vpc.private_subnets
    availability_zones = module.vpc.azs

    vpn_cidr_block = "192.168.128.0/22"
    server_certificate = "<REPLACE>"
    client_certificate = "<REPLACE>"
}
```

**Terraform Setup**
   1. Open a terminal window.
   2. Run the following commands.

   ```
   terraform init
   ```
   ---
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

**Configure Config File**
   - Once the VPN module is applied, on the AWS Console dashboard go to the Client VPN Endpoint section inside the VPC service page, and download the client configuration file

   ![Download client config file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlackArrowGang/Arsenal/dev/quiver/aws-vpn-client/diagrams/image_01.png)

   - Edit this file by adding the location of you client certificate and key at the end of the file
      ```
      cert "C:\custom_folder\client1.domain.tld.crt"
      key "C:\custom_folder\client1.domain.tld.key"
      ```


**Connect to VPN**


   - Desktop Client

      - Go to the section named "Exporting and configuring the VPN client configuration file" of this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/accessing-an-amazon-rds-instance-remotely-using-aws-client-vpn/" target="_blank">AWS</a> documentation to connect with your vpn client.



   - Linux Command
      ```
      sudo openvpn --config config.ovpn
      ```
  
## **How It Works**
1. Local Variables:
   - The code defines several local variables, including the AWS profile, region, resource port, VPC CIDR block, VPN CIDR block, availability zones, private subnets, server certificate, and client certificate.

2. Provider Configuration
   - The code specifies the AWS provider configuration using the local profile and region variables.

3. Client VPN Configuration:
   - The aws_ec2_client_vpn_endpoint resource creates the client VPN endpoint. It sets the description, server certificate ARN, client CIDR block, split tunneling, security group IDs, and VPC ID. It also configures certificate-based authentication and disables connection logging.

   - The aws_ec2_client_vpn_authorization_rule resource sets up an authorization rule for the client VPN endpoint. It authorizes all client VPN groups to access the VPC's target network CIDR block defined in the VPC module.

   - The aws_ec2_client_vpn_network_association resources associate the client VPN endpoint with the specified private subnets from the VPC module, allowing VPN clients to access resources in those subnets.

4. Security Group Modules:
   - The code includes two security group modules: "vpn_access_sg" and "resource_access_sg." The "vpn_access_sg" module allows UDP traffic on port 443 from all IP ranges, while the "resource_access_sg" module allows all inbound and outbound traffic on the specified resource port within the VPC.

5. VPC Module:
   - The code uses the "vpc" module to create a custom VPC. It sets up the VPC with the specified name, CIDR block, availability zones, and private subnets. The VPC module creates the VPC, subnets, route tables, and other associated resources.
