## **Why Choose ARM64?**

- **Cost Optimization:** ARM64-based instances offer cost savings compared to x86-based instances due to their power-efficient design, reducing energy consumption and infrastructure costs.üí∞‚úÖ

- **Performance:** ARM64 processors, like Graviton, can deliver excellent performance for certain types of workloads. They are particularly well-suited for scale-out applications, such as web servers, containerized microservices, and caching fleets.‚ö°Ô∏èüí™üèº

</p>

ARM processors execute one instruction at a time, and it requires less hardware. It consumes less power, and the device‚Äôs battery life that uses this processor is higher. It also generates less heat.üí°üå°Ô∏è

x86 processors have a longer development history than ARM, they have a larger instruction set. This makes them very sophisticated and advanced, which allows you to do a lot of complex calculations in a short amount of time.‚è±Ô∏èüöÄ

## **Use Cases**

1. **Cost-effective Scaling:** Arm64 instances offer a cost-effective solution for scaling workloads that are compatible with the Arm architecture. These instances are typically priced lower compared to their x86 counterparts, making them suitable for applications that can leverage Arm's performance capabilities.

2. **High-Throughput Web Applications:**: Arm64 processors can be advantageous for high-throughput web applications, such as web servers, content delivery networks (CDNs), and microservices. They can efficiently handle large numbers of simultaneous connections, providing responsive and scalable performance.

3. **Scale-out Workloads:** ARM64 instances excel in scale-out workloads, where you distribute the workload across multiple instances. Web servers, microservices, and containerized applications are examples of workloads that can benefit from ARM64's ability to efficiently handle parallel processing and high traffic volumes.


## **Requirements**
| Name     | Version  |
|----------|----------|
|[Git](https://git-scm.com/)  | >= 2.0 |

## **Usage**

To have access to the sample code go to our [Arsenal](https://github.com/BlackArrowGang/Arsenal/tree/main/quiver/gh-actions-arm64-build) repository where you will find all the necessary files for this javascript example.

### Add Files
1. Inside the repository that you want to build in ARM64, create two directories one named `.github` and inside another one named `workflows`
```
mkdir .github/workflows
```

2. Add the `build.yaml` file to the `workflows` directory

3. Add the `Dockerfile` to the root of your project 

### Create AWS S3 Bucket
For this example, the ARM64 build is uploaded to a S3 bucket where can be used by a lambda function.

### Create Secrets

 Go to the secrets section inside the settings of your project repository

- Add the following secretes
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`

## **How It Works**

- Github Actions helps automating the process of building and deploying the project by setting the instructions inside the `build.yaml`

- Docker Buildx allows us to create images in different architectures and that way we can build applications for different architectures like ARM64.

## **Support**
