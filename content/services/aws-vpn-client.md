# **Secure Access Made Simple: Terraform-driven AWS Client VPN**

## **Description**
This repository provides a terraform code to set up an AWS infrastructure with a client VPN endpoint for secure remote access to resources within a VPC. It creates security groups to control access and establishes network associations for private subnets.

## **Use Cases**
The AWS VPN setup can be utilized in various scenarios, including:

1. **Remote Access (Bastion Alternative)**: Provide a secure alternative to a bastion by enabling authorized users to securely connect with high availability to AWS resources through a virtual private network (VPN) from remote locations.

2. **Site-to-Site Connectivity**: Establish secure connections between multiple on-premises data centers or branch offices and the AWS cloud, enabling seamless and protected communication between these environments, including multi-region deployments.

3. **Third-Party Vendor Access**: Many enterprises work with external vendors or consultants who require access to specific resources for collaboration or system integration. Cloud network security plays a vital role in this scenario. This VPN can provide a secure and controlled connection for these vendors to access the necessary resources without exposing the internal network to external threats.

## **How It Works**
1. Provider Configuration:
   - Configures the AWS provider with your default credentials and desired region.

2. Security Group Modules:
   - Creates security group modules with specific configurations:
     - "security_group" allows inbound UDP traffic on port 443 from all IP ranges.
     - "security_group_networks" allows all traffic between networks within the VPC and outbound TCP traffic on the desired port to itself.

3. Client VPN Configuration:
   - Configures an EC2 client VPN:
     - Sets up an authorization rule for VPN access to the entire VPC or a specific CIDR block.
     - Creates a client VPN endpoint with server and client certificates, a client CIDR block, and split tunneling enabled.
     - Associates security groups with the client VPN endpoint.
     - Configures certificate-based authentication.

4. VPC Module:
   - Creates a custom VPC with the CIDR block across two availability zones.
   - Includes two private subnets.
